# What are differential equations, and why are them useful?

Differential equations are the fortune-tellers of science. You give them a information about the present state of a system, and they calculate for you all its future states.

In year 2012 the mathematician Ian Stewart published is book _17 equations that changed the world_. From this selection of 17 influential equations, 9 of them are deeply related to differential equations, and 7 of them are differential equation themselves. Differential equations are the easiest and most common approach to modelling, and the natural language of fields such as population dynamics, chemical kinetics or classical mechanics.

All the problems we are going to deal with in this lesson have the same basic components:

> ## Anatomy of a differential equation problem
> - A rule that given the current state calculates the future states, also known as dynamical equation
> - The current state, also known as initial condition
> - The times we want to know about
