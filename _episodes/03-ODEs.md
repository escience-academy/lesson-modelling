# Prerequisites

The examples in this section will require using some Python libraries. All we need can be loaded by running:

~~~
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
~~~
{: .language-python}

Python's package `scipy` has a powerful differential equation solver called `odeint`. We can load it by running:

~~~
from scipy.integrate import odeint
~~~
{: .language-python}

# Population growth

## Malthusian growth
In 1798, Thomas Malthus published _An essay on the principle of population_. It contained one of the earliest (and also poorest) population growth models. In modern mathematical language, Malthus' model will read as: _the growth rate of a population is proportional to its size_. This can be easily translated to the differential equation:

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = r \cdot y
$$

where $y$ represents the population and $r$ the proportionality coefficient.

### Do it in Python

The following code chunk defines the basic elements needed to solve the initial value problem for $r = 0.1$:

~~~
# Set initial value problem
## Dynamics
def dydt(y, t):
    return 0.1*y

## Initial value
y0 = 0.5

## Set times to solve for
ts = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now we are ready to use `odeint`:
~~~
# Integrate numerically
ys = odeint(dydt, y0, ts)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The previous chunk generates a vector _ys_, whose values correspond to the states at the times given by the vector _ts_.
It is always nice to visualize our solution:
~~~
# Plot solution
plt.plot(ts, ys)
plt.show()
~~~

> ## Question

> In a previous code chunk we defined the dynamics as a function of state ($y$) and time ($t$).
  Actually, the time is not being used in the body of the function.
  I am talking about this chunk:

## Logistic growth
The capacity of a model to predict the future is always limited, and sometimes extremely so.
The malthusian growth model shown in the section above is a particularly poor one.
It predicts something completely unrealistic: that populations grow indefinitely, literally.

Malthus himself was already aware of this important flaw in his model.
He and others proposed certain improvements to the model in order to remove this problem.
The most famous one is known as the logistic model, and was proposed by Pierre-FranÃ§ois Verhulst in 1838.

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = r \cdot y - \frac{r y^2}{k} = r \cdot y \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{y}{k} \right)
$$
